# InnoLibraryManager
Project for Introduction to Programming II, Innopolis 2018.

### Documentation
You can check the documentation by extracting `Documentation.zip` file (we were forced to make it zip because the github had some problems with formatting html files). Then run `html/index.html` in your browser.

### Running
To start InnoLibraryManager, you need to build it dynamically. The simplest way is to use `Qt Creator IDE based on Qt 5.10.1 framework`. The best installation and configuring guide is on the [Qt web page](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-support.html). You only need to install QtCreator along with Qt 5.10 mingw (the version I am using) which is enough to run our current program.

To install Qt Creator and run the project please check [our wiki](https://github.com/hussainkarafallah/InnoLibraryManager/wiki).
